This helpful guide will let Canadians know the basics of mortgages and how to get buy their dream home.

## 1. Are you ready to buy?

The first step in the home buying process is to figure out whether you are ready to buy a home yet or not. Read on to know for sure:

* **Financial Health:**

  * How much debt do you have? Credit card debt, student/auto loans
  * It is best to pay some of these debts off before you look into how to get a mortgage and to buy a home.
  * You should consolidate your loans before getting a mortgage
* **Your Savings:**

  * To buy a home, you should put down more than the minimum required
  * The minimum down payment on a house is 20% and would not need to pay mortgage insurance
* **Personal Goals:**

  * You should be content in living in a specific city or town for at least the next several years
  * Homeownership fits with your personal long-term and short-term goals
* **Job Security:**

  * You must have a reliable income so that you would be able to pay their mortgage payments
  * You know the sense of the type of home that you want
  * Talk to a real estate broker

## **2. Types of Mortgages**

After ensuring that you are financially ready, you should know the types of mortgages available and which one suits your needs the best. Following are the types of mortgages available in Canada:

* **Conventional:** These types of mortgages are typically available if you can make a 20% down payment and may need homeownersâ€™ insurance.
* **Open Mortgage:** You can pay off the balance as quickly as you like without penalties. There would be higher interest rates as this type of mortgage is best for borrowing for a short period.
* **Closed Mortgage:** A fixed-rate is attached to the loan for the duration that you are paying the loan off. The rate is lower than what is found on open mortgages.
* **Variable Rate:** As the prime rate fluctuates, the variable mortgage monthly payments will increase or decrease.
* **Reverse:** You receive cash value for the equity of their home while still living in it. In Canada, you must be 60 years old in order to qualify for this type of mortgage. This mortgage is good for seniors who need extra funds for their retirement years.

## **3. Mortgage Interest Rates**

Each month, you will pay back the portion of the loan, including part of the principal or balance and interest that has been accumulated in the past month. Having a longer-term mortgage, you will pay higher interest rates. In the first several months or years of the mortgage, you are lucky to be able to pay off their principal slowly.

## **4. Mortgage term**

A mortgage term is the length of time you have in order to pay off your balance of the loan. In Canada, you have 6 months to 10 years, after their initial term ends to renew or refinance or pay in full. In a shorter-term mortgage, you will need to renew sooner, and your mortgage rate would go up significantly.

## **5. Searching, Placing an offer, and Closing on your new home**

After having in-depth knowledge on how to get a mortgage, interest rates, mortgage terms, the search for your home can begin. You would need to use a real estate agent, browse websites (ie. Realtor.ca) and visit other open houses. The next step would be to place an offer. The first step in placing an offer is to make a written offer on the home, then the seller reviews it and accepts it, a counteroffer is then made, and it is either accepted or declined. The last step would be to close on the new home. Conduct a home inspection, more paperwork, and secure a mortgage through a lender. The closing process usually takes 1 to 2 months.
