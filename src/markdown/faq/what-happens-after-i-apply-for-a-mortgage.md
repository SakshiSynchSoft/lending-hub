title: What documents are required from me to get a mortgage?

It all depends on your situation â€“ some clients can purchase with 0% down payment, whereas another client may require 20% down payment. Generally, if you have great credit and income, 5% down payment and 1.5% of the house value for closing cost (such as legal fees and disbursements) is fine. When paying 5% down payment, the funds must be from your own sources, they cannot be borrowed from a line of credit, credit cards or family. However, there are several programs available that allow alternate sources of down payment. Call us to know more.
