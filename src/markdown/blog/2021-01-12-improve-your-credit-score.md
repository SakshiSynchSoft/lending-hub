A healthier credit score is a must in Canada. It helps you in getting lower rates and easy approval for credit cards and loans. If you have a bad credit score or just want to improve your credit score for better credit history, there are some simple tips you can use which will help you to improve your credit score immediately. Before we get into the tips for improving your credit score, let’s first understand the basics of credit reports and credit scores.

## **What is a Credit Report?**

A credit report is a summary of your credit history. It summarizes how you have handled credit accounts, including the types of accounts and your payment history, as well as certain other information that’s reported to credit bureaus by your lenders and creditors.

## **What Qualifies as a Good Credit Score?**

A credit score is a three-digit number that comes from the information in your credit report. It shows how well you manage credit and how risky it would be for a lender to lend you money. Credit bureaus provide this number to lenders and others who want to assess your creditworthiness. These include banks, mortgage lenders, insurance companies, utility providers, and in some cases, potential employers.

The credit score can range from bad to excellent. In Canada, credit scores range from 300 to 900, with the following rankings:

* 800 – 900: Excellent
* 720 – 799: Very Good
* 650 – 719: Good
* 600 – 649: Fair
* 300 – 599: Poor

## **Why My Credit Score Dropped?**

There could be several reasons behind the dip in your credit score. Some of these might be

* Missed, late or short payments for your credit cards.
* Financial defaulters such as bankruptcies, consumer proposals, accounts in collections, etc.
* Recent “hard hits” performed by lenders and other organizations when inquiring about your credit history for new credit.
* Starting or canceling too many new accounts within a short period of time.
* Error in your credit report that goes undisputed

## **Tips on How to Improve Your Credit Score**

* **Review your credit report yearly**

  As per the Federal Trade Commission, about 1 in 5 consumers have errors in their credit report that negatively impacts their credit score. Review your credit report at least once a year. If you find incorrect information, contact Equifax or [](https://www.transunion.ca/assistance/credit-report-disputes)TransUnion so they can start the Dispute Resolution process.
* **Pay your bills in a timely manner**

  The first step to improve your credit score is to pay your credit card balances on time every month. Payment history is the most important factor for ranking your score. Late payments register on your credit as negative information. The later the payment is, the more damage you can expect to your credit score. Most creditors will let you set email reminders, or you can create them on your smartphone, so you’re never late again.
* **Don’t Apply for Too Many New Credit Accounts**

  Firstly, applying for too many new credit accounts will make a “hard inquiry” on your credit and will make your credit score drop. Secondly, if you apply for too much new credit in a short period of time, this can make it appear you are relying on credit to make ends meet and raise red flags.
* **Increase Your Credit Limit**

  Maxing out on your credit cards will make your credit score drop more quickly. You should use your credit cards in a responsible way that will not affect your credit score. A good rule of thumb is to spend less than 30% of your credit card limit. If you are spending more than that each month, you should call your credit card companies to increase your credit limit. This will help you to stay under the 30% mark spending and will eventually help you to improve your credit score.
* **Keep Old Credit Alive**

  The length of your credit history influences your credit score. Do not cancel old credit cards in good standing even if you rarely use them now. Keep these cards and use them now and then to show some “activity” on your credit profile. Canceling old lines of credit also lowers your total credit limit and this hurts your credit utilization ratio.
* **Apply for a Secured Credit Card**

  A secured credit card is the perfect financial product for those who may have a hard time getting approved for a traditional credit card or who have bad credit. And applying for a secured credit card to assist you in rebuilding your credit rating. Secured credit cards are loaded with your own money, so you can’t overspend. Plus, they reflect positively on your credit report.
* **Practice Money Management**

  Try to save 10-15% of your net income. If you're unemployed, try to save 2-3% of your net income. You should begin practicing better money management, such as budgeting and tracking your expenses. This will help you understand how much money you have coming in, and how much you have going out. That way, you can determine where you can cut back on to pay down your debt—which kicks up your credit score.
* **Consolidate Your Debt**

  If you have a significant credit balance and find it difficult to keep up with paying it down, a low-interest balance transfer credit card can save you thousands of dollars in interest payments. This will help in consolidating your debt in one place so that you can keep track of it easily. If you qualify for a [personal loan](https://www.savvynewcanadians.com/personal-loans-interest-rates-canada/) at a reasonable rate, you can use this to pay off your credit card balance as well and save money.
