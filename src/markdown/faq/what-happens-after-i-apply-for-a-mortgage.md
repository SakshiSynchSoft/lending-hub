title: What are the benefits of Accelerated Bi-weekly Payments?
---
We suggest our client to choose Accelerated Biweekly Payments for their Mortgage Payments. With accelerated bi-weekly payments, you will make 26 Biweekly, which is equivalent to 13 monthly payments in one year. The extra payment reduces the amortization period as well as increases savings with the reduction of interest payments.
