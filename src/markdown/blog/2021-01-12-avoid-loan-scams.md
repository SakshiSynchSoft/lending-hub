**Avoid Loan Scams**

As the number of lenders who conduct their business solely online is rising, so is the number of loan scams and fraud cases. Loan scams can be employed by untrustworthy individuals or companies posing as legitimate lenders to take advantage of you and skim your money. In today’s digital world, it has become ever so easier for scammers to steal your money and get away with it. There can be many types of loan scams that target people from every demographic:

* Auto Loan Scams
* Student Loan Scams
* Personal Loan Scams
* Mortgage Loan Scams

Fortunately, we have some pretty good tips for you, that you can use to determine whether you falling for a scam or doing a legitimate transaction.

**Tips To Avoid Loan Scams**

1. **Is It Too Good To Be True?**

   The best thing you can do to avoid loan scams is to trust your instincts. If you’re having any seconds thoughts, are skeptical about the legitimacy of the loan being offered to you or the company that’s offering it, or if you think “it is too good to be true” kind of a deal, you absolutely need to follow your instincts. In that case, you need to cautiously before giving out your personal information.
2. **No Credit Check Required**

   Any reputable company needs some reassurance that you will be able to pay their money back to them. For this, they would need a credit check to know your credit history. If you’re being offered guaranteed money without any credit check, it is probably a scam company at work.
3. **Avoid Red Flags**

   There are a number of signs to look out for when trying to protect yourself from scammers. These include

   * Hard to contact – that means they don’t have an online presence and do not disclose these locations or contact information to you.
   * Poor Grammar – Scammers usually have bad writing skills because they are based in other countries. So always look at the spelling and grammar used in the body of the email.
   * Email Address – Sometimes the email address itself is suspicious and can arise questions. And sometimes, when they ask you to respond to an email other than the one in the header, it is most probably a scam.
4. **Urgency or aggressiveness**

   A respected company providing loan will want people to consider all their options and would make you feel comfortable doing business with them. But the scammers would create a sense of urgency. For example, you need to act now or this offer will not be valid in the next 1 hour. Or they would try to intimidate you so that you act quickly. In this case, it is always better to take a step back and analyze the situation calmly.
5. **Upfront payment**One of the most common loan scams is when they ask you to make one or more payments before any loan is approved. They could also ask for money from you in the form of a “processing fee”. It is, in fact, illegal to request payment before a contract has been signed by the lender and the customer. Also, any unusual form of payment, for example, wire transfer, Bitcoin, or gift card is another sign of warning and it is best not to proceed with this particular individual or company.
6. **No reviews or consumer complaints**Nowadays, with everything online and people leaving genuine online reviews, it is best to do your research and read reviews online for the company which is providing you the loan. And if they have a large number of consumer complaints online, or have been called out by other reputable publications, chances are, it is a scam.
7. **Incomplete or no contracts**A trusted company will always have a clear contract and will walk you through it. Scammers and frauds are hesitant to provide contracts or written agreements. And if they do, it will have extremely confusing terminology, blank spaces they can fill in later, and pre-checked boxes.
8. **Unsolicited Loan Approvals**If you ever get a call or an email congratulating you for the approval of the loan you never initiated, it is most definitely a scam and you should report it immediately.

**Report Loan Scams**

With loan scams becoming easier, it is also becoming easier to report them. If you feel you’ve been scammed, you must report it or a suspected scam to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). The best way to report a loan scam is by visiting their website and following the directions. You can also contact them by phone at 1-800-495-8501. You must always report a scam and let the authorities handle it. It would also help others in the future.
