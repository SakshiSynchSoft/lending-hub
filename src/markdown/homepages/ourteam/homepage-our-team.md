  subheading: We understand that for both clients as well as agents buying or
    selling a home is more than just a transaction, it requires a level of trust
    and understanding, which comes down to the morals and values that our
    friendly, reliable and determined staff uphold. Working with RE/MAX
    Millennium means less work, fret and risk. Your real estate transaction is
    one of the largest and most important events in your life. Let us take care
    of it with the attention and experience that is necessary.
