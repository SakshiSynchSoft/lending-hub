## **What is a high-interest savings account?**

In the most basic terms, a high-interest savings account is a bank account that pays interest on deposits. Funds in a high-interest savings account are accessible at your own will. Cash in a savings account is not locked in the account.

Depending on the type of savings account you use, the number of free onthly transactions allowed to you may be limited.That said, savings accounts are ideal for both short-term and long-term savings goals, such as a vacation, wedding, down payment, or retirement.

They also serve as an excellent option for building an [emergency fund](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/what-is-an-emergency-fund/), known commonly as a rainy-day fund. The purpose of any savings account is to keep savings parked or untouched until needed.



## **How do high-interest savings accounts work?**

A high-interest savings account works like a regular savings account. Generally, a high-interest saving account only differs by its provided interest rate. However, savings accounts (and all financial products) differ in terms and conditions from other institutions. The most significant differences between savings accounts generally lie in the number of withdrawals it allows its customers to make.

Some banks and credit unions permit unlimited transactions each month, while other institutions place a limit on transactions. Others offer variations on their accounts, depending on flexibility and transfers.

Banks and credit unions also differ significantly depending on the interest rates, offering fixed rates (one rate that never changes) or a [tiered-interest rate](https://www.ratehub.ca/savings-accounts/tiered-savings-accounts) option.

## **What types of savings accounts can you open in Canada?**

There are many different types of savings accounts available to Canadians, all of which come with their own unique advantages.

**[Savings Accounts](https://www.ratehub.ca/savings-accounts/what-is-a-savings-account)** are accounts meant for saving money that also provide interest.

**High-Interest Savings Accounts** operate in the same manner as traditional savings accounts but have an interest rate higher than 1.00%.

**Tax-Free Savings Accounts** ([TFSAs](https://www.ratehub.ca/investing/what-is-a-tfsa)) are saving and investing accounts that earn tax-free interest on cash, dividends, and savings. A TFSA comes with a [yearly contribution limit](https://www.ratehub.ca/investing/tfsa-contribution-limit) that increases each year for all Canadian citizens. It allows people to earn untaxed interest and gains on their investments.

**Registered Retirement Savings Plan** ([RRSP](https://www.ratehub.ca/investing/what-is-an-rrsp)) is a government-registered account purposed for retirement savings. It is a registered savings account that also earns tax-free interest and comes with a [contribution limit](https://www.ratehub.ca/investing/rrsp-contribution-limit).

**[U.S. Savings Accounts](https://www.ratehub.ca/savings-accounts/us-savings-accounts)** are savings accounts that hold American money. These accounts are available with most major banks and ideal for citizens with dual citizenship or ones who visit the United States often.

A **Hybrid Savings Account** is a savings account that offers the flexibility of a chequing account. Typically, a hybrid account allows customers to make transactions and transfers while providing high-interest and additional features like Interac e-transfers and bill payments, along with high interest.
