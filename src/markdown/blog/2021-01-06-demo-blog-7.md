Although the market value of your home does not directly impact what you pay for home insurance, it can give you an idea of what you can expect to see in terms of costs. Normally it’s your home’s rebuild value you should consider when buying a home insurance policy. Buying home insurance for market value is a mistake because if your house burns down, you still own the property, so only insure for the rebuild value.
